# SharpMind Overview

An innovative educational application designed to enhance learning and comprehension through interactive quizzes generated by AI from user-uploaded documents. Users can upload various file types—text documents, PDFs, presentations, etc.—and the app will automatically generate quiz-style questionnaires based on the content of these files. The primary goal is to provide a AI platform that facilitates active learning by testing users' understanding of the material they upload.

# Problem Statement

In the current educational landscape, students and professionals alike often struggle to assess their comprehension of study materials effectively. Traditional methods of self-testing are time-consuming and often require the creation of custom quizzes or flashcards. SharpMindAI aims to solve this problem by automating the quiz creation process, allowing users to focus on learning and understanding rather than on the mechanics of creating study aids.
